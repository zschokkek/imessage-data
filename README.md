## imessage-data-analysis
A Python script for analyzing iMessage chat data, focusing on message patterns, reactions, and participant engagement. The script processes raw iMessage exports to extract temporal patterns, word frequencies, reaction networks, and name mentions.
The analysis includes message time distributions, reaction heatmaps, activity calendars, and a sophisticated reaction probability network visualization. Key metrics calculated include message counts per participant, reaction frequencies, and name mention analysis. 
The script uses beta distributions to estimate reaction probabilities and includes confidence intervals in the network visualization.
Visualization outputs include hourly message distribution plots, reaction heatmaps showing who reacts to whom, activity calendars displaying message frequency over time, and a network graph showing the strength of reaction relationships between participants.
